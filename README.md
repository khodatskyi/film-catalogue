# Movie Catalog

Movie Catalog is a personal project developed as a frontend application. It utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data and display it to users. The project serves as a platform for users to explore various movies, TV shows, top-rated films, upcoming releases, celebrities, and personal recommendations based on their watchlist. Users can also add movies to their watchlist for easy access later.
